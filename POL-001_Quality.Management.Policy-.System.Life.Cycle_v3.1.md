####**2. Purpose**
The purpose of this policy is to instill the discipline of quality by ensuring the management of quality is at the forefront of every employee’s mind during each phase of Comprehend’s System Development Life Cycle.  The development, implementation, validation and change management of computer systems shall follow and conform to documented requirements in accordance with regulatory guidance and intended uses.

####**3.  Risk Assessment**
A formal computer systems development life cycle (SDLC) and validation policy within Comprehend mitigates risk to our product in that each step of the life of our product is managed with an eye toward quality.  This policy becomes the point of our quality management system, (QMS), which is the framework, upon which we assure each customer receives the same high-level attention to quality.

####**4. Statement of Quality**
At Comprehend, we strive to deliver the best in analytics software.  Quality throughout the system development life cycle is paramount in our work environment.  Per adherence to regulatory authority guidelines on the development of computer systems for clinical trials, we create documented evidence, which provides a high degree of assurance that our system will consistently function, in accordance with its pre-determined specifications and quality attributes throughout its lifecycle.  Comprehend’s policy is to achieve a quality of product that surpasses our client’s needs and expectations.

Senior management demonstrates commitment to quality by issuing this quality policy and ensuring that everyone in the organization reads this policy and understands its implications.  In addition, our QMS is regularly reviewed for compliance and for its ability to meet our quality goals, which include the goal of assisting Sponsors in meeting their goals of accelerating effective medications delivery and patient safety - a goal we share with our customers.  We strive to maintain a professional approach to customer data.

We use QMS to ensure consistency, but with an eye towards continuous improvement.  Comprehend believes that the quality management process involves understanding our customers’ business environment and their IT dependency of the business process.  Our quality commitment is aimed at sustaining client satisfaction through quality measures and professional approach.

A QMS is only as good as the support management provides.  Every professional at Comprehend is selected for their education, expertize and integrity.  The people working here know how important quality is and more importantly, are well versed in quality processes and measures.  QMS functions to mitigate risk, increase clinical trial efficiency, and speed time to market for our clients and for patients.

####**5. Intended Audience**
This document is intended for all Comprehend Systems, Inc. (Comprehend) personnel involved in the development, implementation and/or validation of regulated computer systems.

####**6. Scope**
We are a software company.  As such, our approach to quality and SDLC are around our software product.  This Policy is therefore directed specifically toward our software and the resources utilized to make our software work effectively.

#####**6.1  Inclusions**
This policy encompasses all computer systems developed by or for Comprehend that are subject to or support regulatory requirements. The following items are within scope:

 - Comprehend client software implementation projects (both configurable and non-configurable)
 - Custom developed applications, interfaces, and utilities.

#####**6.2  Exclusions**
The following are excluded from the scope of this policy:

 - Projects undertaken on behalf of Comprehend clients for which the client requires that their internal SDLC and validation procedures be followed.

####**7.  Definitions**
>| *Term* |  *Description / Definition* | 
|:-----|:------|
|*Agile Methodology*  |Software development methodology using the iterative process.  | 
|*Scrum*  |A subset of Agile methodology. A “process framework” with a particular set of practices (Sprints). | 


####**8.  Roles and Responsibilities**
>| *Role* |  *Responsibility* | 
|:-----|:------|
|Comprehend Personnel |Adhere to the established policies and procedures with regard to Systems Development and Computer Systems Validation. |   
|Executive Leadership  |Verify compliance with applicable policies, procedures, and regulations with regard to Systems Development and Computer Systems Validation. | 

####**9. Quality Management System**
An intuitive hierarchy of quality controls and documentation is at the center of any QMS.  This policy is the point of the pyramid (see Section 9.5, QMS Pyramid), under the guidance of which our quality is accomplished.  At Comprehend, the word “system” in quality management system includes our people, our software, our hardware, and our processes.  The term “Procedures” in the pyramid includes all other quality management guiding documentation, such as other policies, guidelines and standard operating procedures.

#####**9.1  Policy**
A QMS policy sets forth the quality focus for the organization.  It is the peak of the QMS pyramid.  All other quality focused documentation (whether policy, guideline, SOP, etc.) supports this policy.

#####**9.2  Procedure**
Supporting guidelines, policies, standard operating procedures make up the second tier of the pyramid.  These documents provide the “how to” of the QMS, in that they describe how to maintain quality in various areas of the organization.

#####**9.3  Work Instruction**
The most granular level of quality guidance documentation is the work instruction.  Work instructions set forth specific processes and procedures through which a particular group, role or function can operate under the guidance of a procedure.

#####**9.4 Quality Record**
The tangible result of a QMS is the quality record.  Quality records can present as anything from validation documentation, testing records, or any other evidence that quality has been produced through a formal process.

#####**9.5 QMS Pyramid**
![9.5 QMS Pyramid graphic](https://github.com/neac/Comprehend-Systems/blob/master/Dec-2015-work/9.5.QMS.Pyramid.graphic.jpg)

####**10.  Validation Policies**
Policies and procedures shall be established to ensure that the development, implementation and validation of computer systems are performed in a manner that supports quality, consistency, formal testing, and, where applicable, formal validation in accordance with regulatory guidelines.

#####**10.1  Systems Development**
An Agile Scrum methodology shall be adopted for computer systems developed and/or implemented by Comprehend:

![10.1 Systems Dev graphic](https://github.com/neac/Comprehend-Systems/blob/master/Dec-2015-work/10.1.Systems.Dev.graphic.jpg)

Determination of the SDLC phases, the extent of software documentation and the level of software verification (testing) required for a development project shall be based on defined factors that may include:

 - System type (purpose, open or closed, etc.)
 -  Impact and risk
 -  Complexity and use
 -  Security requirements

As appropriate, User Requirements Specification (URS), Functional Requirements Specification (FRS), and System Design Specification (SDS) documents shall be retained and available for review during client audits and regulatory inspections.

Documented evidence of all software verification activities shall be retained and available for review during client audits and regulatory inspections.

Once software or pre-configured solutions have been released, application versioning control shall be applied. Source code control shall be maintained throughout the development or configuration process according to established methods.

Throughout SDLC activities, version control shall be applied to development and configuration documentation.

#####**10.2  Systems Validation**
Determination of whether a computer system is subject to validation policies and procedures shall be made based on the occurrence of any system function that creates, modifies, maintains, archives, retrieves or transmits clinical data that is intended for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar regulatory authorities.

Determination of the extent of the validation effort shall be based on defined factors that, when applicable, include:

 - System type (purpose, open or closed, etc)
 - Impact and risk
 - Complexity and use
 - Security requirements
 -  Development controls
 -  Available documentation

Policies and procedures shall be established to ensure that computer systems subject to validation requirements are validated, controlled and maintained to regulatory and industry standards.

Every computer system subject to validation shall have documented requirements that fully define its intended use, and evidence against which testing results and other evidence can be compared to show that the software is validated for its intended use.

All validation projects shall follow a pre-defined written plan.

Validation projects shall consist of Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ).  Where applicable, projects may also include a User Acceptance Testing phase.

For each validation effort:

 - Traceability documenting full test coverage of all requirements shall be created and retained.
 -  Documented evidence of validation testing (e.g. executed test case scripts, summary reports, etc) shall be retained.
 
A formal summary of all validation testing shall be created and approved.

####**11.  Training Records**
Evidence of formal training will be created and kept on file for each employee.

####**12.  Incident Management**
Incidents will be reported and managed per our Incident Management Procedure.

####**13.  Internal Audits**
Evidence of an annual audit of Comprehend’s ability to follow its QMS will be created and shared per the Internal Compliance and Audit Program.

####**14.  Deliverables**
There are no specific deliverables created from following this policy.
